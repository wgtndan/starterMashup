# starterMashup

This is a quick mashup sample to give you some ideas and comfort about how to easily utilise the power of Node.JS to easily consume a Qlik ticket, and start rendering content using the capabilities API!

## Getting Started

Export Certificates from Qlik (required for Ticket Authentication Communications)
Move Cert Files to a location that the user running Node.JS can access, i.e. starterMashup app.js location/Certificates
Update config.js with values that work for your environment
Execute the Node app

```
node .\bin\www
```

### Prerequisites

Node.JS
A functional Qlik Sense implementation
Certificates Exported from Qlik Sense
